  {question: "<span style='color: darkred;'>September 2016 - Question 172</span> Effective health counseling skills are a critical component of meeting the educational needs of patients and families and providing expert coaching and guidance for people who are managing diabetes on a daily basis. Health counseling includes skills such as effectively providing information, counseling patients about available options, and helping them make well-informed decisions through a client-centered approach. A positive interaction between the clinical nurse specialist (CNS) and the patient can have a positive effect on diabetes management. The CNS can help to make the interaction positive by showing sensitivity to the patient and by having empathy and understanding of the patient's feeling, which will also enhance patient satisfaction. Another approach to improving adherence is to establish a therapeutic contract with the patient in which the patient and provider work together to set goals, assign responsibilities, and set a date for attaining the goal.

    {question: "<span style='color: darkred;'>March 2017 - Question 172</span> Read the following passage carefully and by selecting the one item -a,b,c, or d- appropriately complete the statements which follow. Then mark your answer sheet.<br/><br/>The prevalence of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults ranges from 0.19 to 21 percent. The range is wide because of differing definition of clinically significant microscopic hematuria and varying ages of the study populations. Urine normally contains a few red blood cells, and microscopic hematuria generally is defined as one to 10 red blood cells per high-power field of urine sediment. The American Urological Association (AUA) defines clinically significant microscopic hematuria as three or more red blood cells per high-power field on microscopic evaluation of urinary sediment from two of three properly collected urinalysis specimens. Each laboratory, however, establishes its own thresholds based on the method of detection used and in reference to healthy persons as controls. Urine dipstick evaluation may be misleading because it lacks the ability to distinguish red blood cells from myoglobin or hemoglobin. Therefore, a positive finding of microscopic hematuria on urinary dipstick testing required follow-up examination by microscopic technique to confirm the presence of red blood cells. Microscopic hematuria, unlike gross hematuria, is often an incidental finding but may be associated with urologic malignancy in up to 10 percent of adults. Despite the risk, result of recent study revealed that 39 to 90 percent of persons with microscopic hematuria on screening urinalysis received no follow-up testing. Microscopic hematuria presents a challenging clinical scenario for family physicians.<br/><br/>A follow-up examination by microscopic technique may be needed to...........",

    {question: `<span style='color: darkred;'>September 2019 - Question 172</span> The investigation of the origin of health and disease brings understanding of some of the underlying mechanisms, an opportunity to optimize fetal and early childhood on both individual and societal levels, and hope for prevention, or at least mitigation, of the consequences of adverse environments. In early childhood, there are protective effects of the presence of nurturing adult caregivers, as their response to stress is better regulated than in children who lack nurturing caregivers. Children whose parents are less nurturing but were themselves raised by more nurturing caregivers still enjoy the benefit of more appropriate responses to stress and perhaps decreased frequency of some adult diseases. Further, language-rich environments appear to enhance linguistic abilities, which optimize academic outcomes. Optimizing children’s physical, psychological, and academic health through good nutrition, nurturing caregiving, and high volume exposure to quality language seems a modest ambition with potentially tremendous individual and societal benefits. 
    The nature-nurture argument regarding the origin of health and disease seems to be coming to a neutral closure. Nature provides the underpinnings of genetic endowment. However, it is very likely that protections for health, disease, and developmental constitution be improved through mechanisms of organogenesis, neuroendocrine alterations, and epigenetics. Moreover, it is becoming clear that nurture, understood as environmental influences, includes the prenatal, fetal, early childhood, and previous generation environments, all of which may influence the nature of the individual child, entire generations, and subsequent generations.<br><br> The main purpose of the writer in the passage is to ____.`, options: ["Imply that altering environmental influences are necessary", "Discuss the role of poor nutrition and care giving", "Justify the role of language in healthy children", "Explain the role of nature and nurture in protecting health"], answer: 3},

    "A global survey on implementation of national infection prevention and control programs by the World Health Organization highlights the urgent need to reduce inequalities in the availability of good hand hygiene and other infection prevention and control measures between high and lower income countries. This is a serious challenge at any time, but COVID-19 has dramatically demonstrated just how important good hand hygiene practices are in reducing the risk of transmission, when used as part of a comprehensive package of preventative measures. Good hand hygiene is also vital in preventing any infections acquired in health care, the spread of antimicrobial resistance, and other emerging health threats. Infection acquired during health care delivery is a major global health problem, but patients in low- and middle-income countries are twice as likely to experience this as patients in high-income countries; the risk in intensive care units, especially among newborns, is between 2 and 20 times higher. One reason for this is that in some low-income countries only 1 in 10 health workers practices proper hand hygiene while caring for patients at high risk of health care-associated infections in ICU - often because they simply do not have the facilities to do so. Lack of financial resources and crumbling infrastructures are key challenges. A 2020 WHO report reveals that globally, 1 in 4 health care facilities do not have basic water services and 1 in 3 lack hand hygiene supplies at the point of care."

    "Teaching basic science should be incorporated into a larger concept of progress toward independence than that ‘knowledge is an essential competence’. Educational leaders should be aware that a growing body of evidence supports the teaching of basic science as an essential step in solving complicated or unusual clinical problems, and not be discouraged by the fact that clinicians do not routinely mention the basic science facts that underlie our diagnostic reasoning. Little attention has yet been paid to articulating the role of basic science in teaching therapeutic management, but this author believes that teachers should continue to insist on an understanding of mechanisms as at least as important as epidemiologic studies. We should be aware that students are often still achieving understanding in a setting in which their teachers are focused on action (whether or not understanding is complete). Successful incorporation of science into medical practice through education depends on the effort to make this step an explicit priority."

Genetically engineered killer cells are to assist in the fight against cancer. The technique is as painless as a normal infusion. The cancer patients receive an injection of killer cells. These immune cells, which attack the tumor, have been previously modified in the laboratory. In order to increase their effectiveness, they are bombarded with minute gold spheres which carry special genetic information. During this process, the spheres penetrate the nucleus of the defense cells, which are then administered to the patient. "Killer cells should attack and consume the tumor," explains the Berlin-based molecular biologist Professor Burghardt Witting. Expectations remain modest as this is still a purely experimental therapy for fatally ill cancer patients who no longer respond to any other forms of treatment. Nevertheless, "it was high time that we left the laboratory and went to the patients, because genetic therapy is the only chance to triumph over cancer." This passage is mainly about …… .`,

        question: `<span style='color: darkred;'>September 2021 - Question 186</span> A great challenge to a sustainable healthcare is currently represented by the advancement of biomedical and digital science and technologies, which, jointly with the demographic trends and the expectations of citizens, are suspected to act to widen the gap between the available resources and the requirements for healthcare. In imaging future healthcare, in fact, some core technology-based components of a more personalized approach to health can be envisaged: the availability of comprehensive electronic health records, the use of biomarker assays including whole genome sequencing at key points in life course, and the continuous self-monitoring of lifestyle parameters using mobile connectivity systems. These components can be considered as a number of inputs and outputs comprising a system that aims to achieve better health for individuals and populations, through delivering more effective preventive and therapeutic interventions. The inputs are the data themselves from multiple sources, and knowledge abstracted from these that will be accrued by both health care providers and citizens themselves.

Climate change worsens existing health inequities. For example, urban heat islands disproportionately affect communities of color. Disproportionate exposure to extreme heat in these urban settings has been linked to the historical and structurally racist housing policy known as “redlining”. Physicians can advocate policies that dismantle structural injustice, protect patients, and avoid worsening health inequities among at-risk populations. As such, content on climate change should be considered in designing curricula to address the large burden of climate-associated conditions that occur in at-risk, vulnerable, disadvantaged, medically complex, or special populations. These principles can be used to build foundational and specialized educational formats and experiences for residency training.`

        <b>Passage:</b><br> 
        Schizophrenia is often confused with multiple personality disorder yet it is quite distinct from it. Schizophrenia is one of the more common disorders, considerably more common than multiple personality disorder. The term “schizophrenia” is composed of roots which mean “a splitting of the mind,” but it does not refer to a division into separate and distinct personalities, as occurs in the multiple personality disorders. Instead, schizophrenic behavior is generally characterized by illogical thought patterns and withdrawal from reality. Schizophrenics often live in a fantasy world where they hear voices that other people cannot hear, often voices of famous people. Schizophrenics tend to withdraw from families and friends and communicate mainly with the “voices” that they hear in their minds.<br>
        It is common for the symptoms of schizophrenia to develop during the late teen years or early twenties, but the causes of schizophrenia are not well understood. It is believed that heredity may play a part in the onset of schizophrenia. In addition, abnormal brain chemistry also seems to have a role; certain brain chemicals, called neurotransmitters, have been found to be at abnormal levels in some schizophrenics.<br><br>
        Which of the following is true about schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder?`,

        <b>Passage:</b><br>
        In addition to eye movements, considerable research has been done on pupil dilation. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in Italy, women used to put drops of belladonna (which literally means “beautiful woman”) into their eyes to enlarge the pupils so that they would look more attractive. Contemporary research seems to support the intuitive logic of these women; dilated pupils are in fact judged to be more attractive than constricted pupils.<br>
        In one study, photographs of women were retouched. On one set the pupils were enlarged, and in another they were made smaller. Men were then shown the photographs and asked to judge the women’s personalities. The photos of women with small pupils drew responses such as cold, hard, and selfish; those with dilated pupils drew responses such as feminine and soft. The male observers, however, could not verbalize the reasons for the different perceptions. Pupil dilation and reactions to change in the pupil size of others both seem to function below our level of awareness.<br>
        Pupil size is also indicative of one’s interest and level of emotional arousal. One’s pupils enlarge when one is interested in something or when one is emotionally aroused.

    // Reading Passage 1
    { question: `<span style='color: darkred;'>August 2022 - Question 181</span> Passage 1: "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a bacterium living in the lining of the stomach. More than half of the world’s population is infected with H. pylori which causes inflammation of the stomach lining (known as gastritis) and increased production of gastric acid. Nearly everyone who is infected with H. pylori develops gastritis (inflammation of the lining of the stomach), but he/she may not show any symptoms. When there are symptoms, it is known as H. pylori-associated dyspepsia. If you are infected with H. pylori, you are more likely than other people to develop ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. H. pylori infection causes most cases of an uncommon disease called gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma – a slow-growing lymphoma which starts in the stomach. If the H. pylori infection is treated successfully when the lymphoma is low grade, there is often regression of the lymphoma, meaning that it gets smaller and may even be cured. If H. pylori infection is associated with symptoms, the patients may experience burning pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen below the ribs, indigestion, burping, nausea and/or vomiting, bloating, loss of appetite and feeling full. There are several ways H. pylori can be detected. Your doctor will request the right tests for you, which might include breath test, blood test, stool (poo) sample and endoscopy with tissue biopsy of the stomach lining. Your doctor can advise whether you would benefit from testing and treatment, based on your medical history and background." <br> According to the text, more than 50 percent of the world population have ………`, options: ["gastritis", "dyspepsia", "ulcer", "lymphoma"], answer: 0 },

In the latter group of patients, there seems to be a spectrum of steroid effectiveness; some individuals remain symptom-free on small corticosteroid doses, whereas others require relatively high doses for even modest symptom control. A small subset of patients gains little benefit from corticosteroids while remaining responsive to β-adrenergic agonists—that is, they are steroid resistant. The precise mechanisms underlying steroid resistance are unknown but are thought to relate to the manner in which steroids exert their effects at the cellular level. Corticosteroids are transported into nucleus bound to receptors and there they attach to DNA sites that code for cytokine production. Corticosteroid resistance has been related to defect in DNA binding, a decrease in the number of corticosteroid receptor and decreased ligand-receptor affinity." <br> According to the text, bronchial asthma ……… in the airway.`, options: ["is merely an abnormality of smooth muscles", "is a neural deficiency", "has a mediatory role", "is the inflammation of the cells"], answer: 3 },

        question: `<span style='color: darkred;'>August 2023 - Question 171</span> 
        The concept of health holds different meanings for different people and groups. 
        These meanings of health have also changed over time. 
        This change is no more evident than in Western society today when notions of health and health promotion are being challenged and expanded in new ways. 
        During the 1980s and 1990s, there has been a growing swing away from seeing lifestyle risks as the root cause of poor health. 
        While lifestyle factors remain important, health is also being viewed in terms of the social, economic, and environmental contexts in which people live. 
        This is called the socio-ecological view of health. 
        The comprehensive socio-ecological view of health was endorsed at the first International Conference of Health Promotion held in 1986 in Ottawa, Canada, 
        where people from 38 countries agreed and declared that: 
        <br><br>
        "The fundamental conditions and resources for health are peace, shelter, education, food, a viable income, a stable ecosystem, sustainable resources, social justice, and equity. 
        Health improvement requires a secure foundation in these basic requirements (WHO, 1986)."
        <br><br>
        It is clear from this statement that the creation of health is about much more than encouraging healthy individual behaviors and lifestyles and providing appropriate medical care. 
        Therefore, the creation of health must include addressing issues such as poverty, pollution, urbanization, natural resource depletion, social alienation, and poor working conditions. 
        The social, economic, and environmental contexts that contribute to health creation do not operate separately or independently of each other. 
        Rather, they are interacting and interdependent, and their complex interrelationships determine the conditions that promote health. 
        A broad socio-ecological view of health suggests that health promotion must include a solid social, economic, and environmental focus.
        <br><br>
        The author of this passage seems to be ------------ about/of the present focus of health, i.e., individuals’ lifestyle.`,

        question: `<span style='color: darkred;'>August 2023 - Question 176</span> 
        The primary function of the endocrine system is to keep the body in homeostasis, the body’s internal state of equilibrium that is maintained so that all the body systems can function most effectively. 
        The endocrine system includes glands that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream rather than through a duct (exocrine glands). 
        Thus, the endocrine system comprises a network of ductless glands, which have a rich blood supply that enables the hormones they produce to enter the blood stream and influence body function. 
        Although the hormones travel throughout the entire body in blood and lymph, they affect only targets that have specific receptors for the hormone. 
        Once bound to the receptor, the hormone initiates a specific biological effect. Hormones control diverse activities such as growth, metabolism, reproduction, energy level, and sexual characteristics. 
        Although the nervous system provides many of the same functions as the endocrine system, it is designed to act instantaneously by transmitting electrical impulses to specific body locations. 
        It is one of the most complicated systems of the body. Nonetheless, the endocrine and nervous systems work together like an interlocking super-system to control many intricate activities of the body.<br><br>

        question: `<span style='color: darkred;'>August 2024 - Question 181</span> Through a technique known as adopted cell therapy, doctors replicated a woman’s own immune cells in the lab; then, they released them into her bloodstream. The tumors began melting away. Scientists are making strides in a new cancer treatment that manipulates the patient’s immune system into going to war with malignant growths. The therapy, which could apply to a wide range of cancers, offers a silver lining for patients diagnosed with melanomas in the lungs, bladder and gastrointestinal tract. For example, in a recently published study, doctors “sequenced the genome” of a 43 year-old woman, who had been struggling with a similar type of cancer that had not responded to chemotherapy. Through what is called “adopted cell therapy,” Dr. Rosenberg and colleagues, identified “cells from her immune system that attacked a specific mutation in the malignant cells. Then they grew those immune cells in the laboratory and infused billions of them back into her bloodstream,” said the Times. Rosenberg told the Times that through the process, the tumors began “melting away”. He added, “It’s the first time we have been able to actually target a specific mutation in the immune system,” Rosenberg told NBC News.<br><br> What is the main idea of the passage?`,

    { 
        question: `<span style='color: darkred;'>August 2024 - Question 186</span> Studies suggest relations between sleep and weight, indicating that the quantity and quality of sleep may influence hormones related to appetite. It wasn’t until recently that appetite entered the picture thanks to research on leptin and ghrelin. Doctors say both hormones, affecting our appetite, may be influenced by our sleep.<br><br>Leptin and ghrelin control feelings of hunger and fullness. Ghrelin, produced in the gastrointestinal tract, increases appetite, while leptin, produced in fat cells, sends a fullness signal to the brain. So, what’s the connection to sleep? When you don’t get enough sleep, it lowers leptin levels, so you don’t feel as satisfied after eating. It also makes ghrelin levels rise, so your appetite is increased, and you want more food. These two combined can lead to overeating and weight gain.<br><br>Having done studies on weight gain and sleep, researchers also suggest getting more sleep might reduce obesity, but the relationship is not clear because of “sleep apnea,” which stops breathing for up to a minute, sometimes hundreds of times while sleeping. The disruption in breathing prevents them from getting deep sleep.<br><br>So how does sleep apnea influence weight gain? First, patients with sleep apnea are more likely to be obese. However, they do not have the low leptin levels connected with being overweight but have abnormally high leptin levels. Then, when their apnea is treated, leptin levels drop and that helps them lose weight.<br><br> What does paragraph one mainly suggest?`, 
        options: ["sleep directly decreases our appetite", "our appetite influences leptin and ghrelin", "sleep affects the two hormones", "leptin and ghrelin affect our sleep"],
